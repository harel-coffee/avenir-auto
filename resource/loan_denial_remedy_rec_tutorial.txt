This tutorial is for remedial action recommendation for a loan application.  A neural neuwork model 
for predicting   loan approbval is used for predictions. A genetic algorithm based optimizer is used to
generate candidate solutions

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib  ../supv directories with all the python files in there wrt 
where loan_approve.py is. Alternatively you can use ../python/app directory of avenir as
your working directory

Train NN model
==============
Prepare training data, validation data and train model as per instructions in the tutorial document 
model_performance_with_class_sep_metric_tutorial.txt. Make sure model is saved after training with 
the parameter setting train.model.save=True

Generate remedial action recommendation
=======================================
./mlremedy.py lo_remedy.properties tnn_lo.properties ffnn lo_remedy.json <rec>

where 

lo_remedy.properties = optimizer config file
tnn_lo.properties = ML model config file
ffnn = type of ML model, feed forward neural network in this case
lo_remedy.json  = cost config file
rec = record to be be processed for recommendation e.g I used 3K5FG92033,single,1,1,1,43,6.63,1.20,50,571,7,540,60,41,0

you should use the model to make predictions. Then choose a record for which approval probability 
has been predicted to be less than 0.5

The output appears in the console
