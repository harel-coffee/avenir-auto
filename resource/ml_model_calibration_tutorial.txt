This tutorial is for finding how well  calibrated a model is. A neural neuwork model for predicting 
heart disease is used for this purpose

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib  ../supv directories with all the python files in there wrt 
where heart_disease.py is. Alternatively you can use ../python/app directory of avenir as
your working directory

Generate training data
======================
raw data
./heart_disease.py generate <bsamp> <noise> <key_len> > hd.txt
where
nsamp = num of samples e.g. 5000
noise = noise level e.g 0.1
key_len = key length e.g. 10

encode categorical data
./heart_disease.py genDummyVar hdn.txt <key_len> > hd_5000.txt
where
key_len = key length e.g. 10

Generate validation data
========================
raw data
./heart_disease.py generate <bsamp> <noise> <key_len> > hdv.txt
where
nsamp = num of samples e.g. 500
noise = noise level e.g 0.1
key_len = key length e.g. 10

encode categorical data
./heart_disease.py genDummyVar hdvn.txt <key_len> > hd_500.txt
where
key_len = key length e.g. 10

Train model
===========
Make sure you have the setting  train.model.save=True so that the trained model is saved
./heart_disease.py nnTrain tnn_hd.properties


Find calibration and draw reliability diagram
=============================================
./heart_disease.py calib tnn_hd.properties

Find local calibration
======================
./heart_disease.py calibLoc tnn_hd.properties

Find  sharpness
===============
./heart_disease.py sharpness tnn_hd.properties
