This tutorial is for conformal prediction of neural regression model.  A neural neuwork model for predicting  
loan amount is used for this purpose

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib  ../supv directories with all the python files in there wrt 
where loan_approve.py is. Alternatively you can use ../python/app directory of avenir as
your working directory

Preparing training data
=======================
Use instriction in model_performance_with_class_sep_metric_tutorial.txt.Create 8000 samples

Use of 
./loan_approve.py amtarg <file_path>t  > loam_tr.txt

file_path = file created from from earlier 

Preparing validation data
=========================
Use steps as before for training data with 2000 samples. Call it loam_va.txt

Preparing prediction data
=========================
Use steps as before for training data with 200 samples. Call it loam_pr.txt

Add noise to prediction data
./loan_approve.py addnoiseic loam_pr.txt > lp.txt
mv lp.txt loam_pr.txt

Train neural regression model
=============================
./loan_approve.py nnTrain tnn_loam.properties

Create conformal prediction calibration model
=============================================
./loan_approve.py confcal  tnn_loam.properties <conf_bound>  <cal_file>
where
conf_bound = confidence bound e.g 0.9
cal_file = file path where calibration result is saved e.g for my case ./model/tnn/confcal.mo 

Make conformal prediction
=========================
./loan_approve.py confpred  tnn_loam.properties  <cal_file>
where
cal_file = file path where calibration result was saved
