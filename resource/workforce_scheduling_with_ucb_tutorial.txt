This tutorial is for work force scheduling with Multi Arm Bandit (MAB)  algorith called UCB.  

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib  ../reinf directories with all the python files in there wrt 
where wfshed.py is. Alternatively you can use ../python/app directory of avenir as
your working directory

Ruuning
=======
./wfsched.py <no_worker>

where 
no_worker = no of workers e.g 100

A coomand loop starts with thee menu choices 1. schedule 2. process 3. exit. You should start with schedule
then alternate between schedule and process as many time as you want. Choose exit when you want to quit

Different use case
==================
You can use wfsched.py as anexaple. Most of the chages will be in the reawrd simulation logic
