This tutorial is measuring model performance with class separation metric. A neural neuwork model for 
predicting  loan approval is used for this purpose

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib  ../supv directories with all the python files in there wrt 
where loan_approve.py is. Alternatively you can use ../python/app directory of avenir as
your working directory

Generate training data
======================
raw data
./loan_approve.py genTwo <num_loans> <noise> <key_len>  extra > lo.txt
where
num_loans = num of loans e.g. 5000
noise = noise level e.g 0.1
key_len = key length e.g. 10

encode categorical data
./loan_approve.py encDummy lo.txt extra > lo_5000.txt


Generate validation data
========================
raw data
./loan_approve.py genTwo <num_loans> <noise> <key_len>  extra > lo.txt

where
nsamp = num of samples e.g. 500
noise = noise level e.g 0.1
key_len = key length e.g. 10

encode categorical data
./loan_approve.py encDummy lo.txt extra > lo_500.txt

Train model
===========
Make sure you have the setting  train.model.save=True so that the trained model is saved
./loan_approve.py nnTrain tnn_lo.properties

Find class sepration KS metric
=============================
./loan_approve.py clsep tnn_lo.properties
