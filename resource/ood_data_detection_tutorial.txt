This tutorial is for out of distribution data  for a machine learning model.  A neural neuwork model 
for predicting loan approbval is used for predictions. The technique uses hidden layer output
and k nearest neighbor nalgorithm

Setup
=====
Make sure you have ../lib  ../supv directories with all the python files in there wrt 
where loan_approve.py is. Alternatively you can use ../python/app directory of avenir as
your working directory

Train NN model
==============
Prepare training data, validation data and train model as per instructions in the tutorial document 
model_performance_with_class_sep_metric_tutorial.txt. Make sure model is saved after training with 
the parameter setting train.model.save=True

Use this tutorial to generate input data used below

Generate neareat latent output and neighbor distance data
=========================================================
./loan_approve.py detood <mod_config_file> <input_data_file> <latent_output_file_path> <dist_output_file_path> gen

mod_config_file = neural model config file. I have used tnn_lo.properties
input_data_file =  refrence input data file path
latent_output_file_path = path to file where latent output will be written
dist_output_file_path = path to file where nearest neighbor distances will be written

Detect out of disttribution data
================================
./loan_approve.py detood <mod_config_file> <input_data_file> <latent_output_file_path> <dist_output_file_path> det <up_conf_bound>

mod_config_file = neural model config file. I have used tnn_lo.properties
input_data_file =  test input data file path
latent_output_file_path = path to file containing latent output (generated in the previous step)
dist_output_file_path = path to file where containing nearest neighbor distance (generated in the previous step)
up_conf_bound = upper confidence bound e.g 0.9
