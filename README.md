## Introduction
Set of predictive and exploratory machine learning tools. Runs on Hadoop, Spark and Storm

## Philosophy
* Simple to use
* Input output in CSV format
* Metadata defined in simple JSON file
* Extremely configurable with tons of configuration knobs

## Solution
* Exploratry analytic including correlation, feature subset selection
* Naive Bayes
* Discrimininant analysis
* Nearest neighbor
* Decision tree and Random Forest
* Association Mining
* Reinforcement learning
* Stochastic Optimization
